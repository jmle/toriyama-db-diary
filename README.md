Toriyama's Dragon Ball diaries
--
I found out that Kanzenshuu had all the remarks and notes that Toriyama used to write on each one of the original Shonen Jump Dragon Ball episodes. I thought it would be nice to compile them into a single page for reference. They provide a glimpse into the day-to-day of our beloved manga artist, his hobbies, and from time to time his struggles to get the job done by the deadline!

Enjoy.
